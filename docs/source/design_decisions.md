GeoSmith makes strong choices.

GeoSmith separates geometry from file formats. A spatial object remains valid whether it came from a shapefile, a database, or memory.

GeoSmith keeps coordinate reference systems explicit. Reprojection never happens silently.

GeoSmith treats raster and vector operations as equal citizens. Neither dominates the design.

GeoSmith avoids implicit plotting. Visualization belongs to Plotsmith or external GIS tools.

GeoSmith favors explicit workflows over magic convenience. Every operation states what it does and why.

These decisions reduce surprises. They support correctness, auditability, and reuse across spatial analytics projects.
