GeoSmith Documentation
=======================

GeoSmith builds structure from space.

Geospatial work often collapses into ad hoc scripts. File formats leak into logic. Geometry operations mix with I O and plotting. GeoSmith breaks that pattern.

GeoSmith treats spatial analysis as a system. Data enters once. Geometry and raster operations stay pure. Tasks define intent. Workflows connect results to files and maps.

GeoSmith fits practitioners who work with real spatial data. Coordinates arrive in mixed reference systems. Shapes overlap imperfectly. Rasters differ in resolution and extent. GeoSmith keeps these realities explicit.

GeoSmith does not aim to replace full GIS platforms. It provides a clean, reproducible core for spatial analytics that integrates with time series, anomaly detection, and domain models across the smith ecosystem.
